# REST API Spring Boot

Family Cash Card service â€” an app for families to manage allowances in the form of digital debit cards. By building this service from start to finish, I learned about REST APIs, Spring Security, data persistence, metrics, and modern application development.

### Project Outcomes

* Build a fully functional REST API with Spring Boot.
* Spring Security to authenticate and authorize the application.
* Implement test-driven development.
* Convert database and Java objects automatically using Spring Data JDBC.
* Accessing data with MySQL using Spring Data
